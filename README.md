# KNN_Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies a data point based on the majority class of its neighbors.

Suppose you have a dataset of car purchases where the features are age and annual salary, and the labels are whether or not the person purchased a car. If a new personâ€™s age and salary are provided, KNN can predict whether this person will purchase a car based on the nearest people in the dataset.

** Social_Network_Ads.csv -- used for training the model
** randomnew_records.csv --- random records passed to predict purchased or not
** knn_pred.csv ------------ outputfile with new col y_pred
